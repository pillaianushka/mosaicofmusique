       <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">
      Country Music is a form of popular music which originated in the early 20th century in the rural southern and western US. The genre focusses on lyricism and melody.
      It is a mixture of ballads and dance tunes and is usually played on the fiddle, banjo, guitar, and pedal steel guitar.
      The lyrics are often based on stories about rural life, working-class experiences, and love, reflecting particular American musical traditions and values.
      It's origins have been traced to the southern Appalachian Mountains in the late 1920s, especially in eastern Tennessee and southwest Virginia.
      Country is a Top 40 genre. In the twenty-first century, mainstream country music rivals hip hop and dance pop for dominance of the Billboard charts. Singer-songwriters like Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, Eric Church, Carrie Underwood and Lady Antebellum enjoy widespread airplay and inclusion on pop music streaming playlists.  
Televised industry events like the Country Music Awards (CMA) have brought further awareness to the genre and increased its reach.

         <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">
   Country music emerged in the mountain towns surrounding Bristol, Tennessee in the 1920s. Early stars of the genre included Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family
Country music first became popular on local radio. In the mid-20s a radio program recorded in Nashville, called Grand Ole Opry, brought country music to a national audience.
String bands were popular in the 1930s and '40s. Performing as bluegrass string bands, some artists created country hits based around dynamic playing. These players became stars of Appalachia, Texas, and rural America after performing in clubs known as honky tonks and on radio broadcasts.
Country singers dominated rural radio. During the same period, "singing cowboys" and crooners brought country songs to the masses.
Country's popularity grew in the second half of the century.
Following in the footsteps of Johnny Cash, a star of 1950s and 1960s country music, some artists rejected the commercial trappings of mainstream country and over time, they pioneered a subgenre known as outlaw country.
Alt country took hold among indie rock fans. Country music has long had an alternative side, anchored by songwriters such as Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark. Their songwriting and performance style helped inspire the alt-country movement of the 1990s and 2000s.
In 2019, the PBS network aired an eight-part documentary series on country music, directed by Ken Burns, that broadly documented the evolution of country from hillbilly music to jukebox standards to international pop hits.

                The country music of Texas honky tonks may sound different from pop country hits, but several elements unify the genre.


1. Folk harmonies: Most country music is based on traditional chord progressions built off of a major scale. Non-diatonic chords are less common than in other genres.
2. String instruments: Most country groups base their instrumentation around string instruments like guitar, bass, pedal steel, lap steel, banjo, and fiddle.
3. Twangy vocals: Whether country artists are from West Virginia or Canada, most sing with a twang in their voice. This helps distinguish country music from other pop genres.
4. Confessional lyrics: Many country songs tell stories about love, heartache, hard work, and personal pride. A good number take the form of ballads, which are songs that tell a story.
5. Frequent duets: From its inception, country music emphasized group singing. Early acts like the Carter Family featured family members singing together. In more recent years, country singers like Miranda Lambert found pop success by teaming up with other vocalists.

                    Country music's spread was significantly boosted by migration and media. During the Great Depression and WWII, Southern populations moving to industrial cities introduced country music to new areas. Media, including radio and recordings, then helped it reach a wider audience, eventually establishing it as a mainstream genre.
                    Here's a more detailed look:
                    Migration:
                    The movement of people from the rural South to urban centers during the 1930s and 40s carried country music with them. This exposed the music to new audiences and influenced its development, leading to the emergence of subgenres like honky-tonk and western swing.
                    Early Media:
                    The 1920s marked the beginning of country music's presence in recorded music, with artists like the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers gaining popularity. Radio played a crucial role, broadcasting country music to homes across the nation.
                    Post-War Boom:
                    World War II further expanded country's reach, with the USO bringing it to military personnel and civilians overseas. The post-war era saw country music become a major commercial force.
                    Nashville's Role:
                    Nashville, Tennessee, became the center of country music, with the establishment of recording studios, publishing houses, and performance venues. This solidified its position as the hub for the genre's development and spread.
                    Continuing Evolution:
                    Country music continues to evolve, with influences from other genres and adaptations to changing social landscapes. Subgenres like "bro country" have emerged, though they've also sparked debate within the country music community.
