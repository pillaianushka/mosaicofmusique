      <h1>What Is Blues Music?</h1>
      <p>Blues music is a genre of music that originated in the Deep South of the United States in the late 19th century. It developed from African American spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, and chants, often sung by enslaved and oppressed people.</p>
      <p>Blues music has some common themes: heartbreak, hardships, life struggle, love and loss, and perseverance.</p>


      <h2>A Brief History of Blues Music</h2>
      <p>Much of the early blues tradition began in the Mississippi Delta, where formerly enslaved people and their descendants worked as sharecroppers. Blues has its origins in the late 1800s. The spirituals, work songs, and "field hollers" of the time served as popular music within this community. Over the latter decades of the 19th century, these melodies inspired a new genre unto itself.</p>
      <p>The blues was born in the 1910s. The blues began to enter popular music in the first decade of the twentieth century. Memphis was an early hub for the musical style, hosting artists like Memphis Minnie and W.C. Handy (who paid homage to the city in his composition "Memphis Blues"). Handy composed "St. Louis Blues" in recognition of another ascendant blues city.</p>
      <p>Juke joints helped popularize the genre. During this era, juke joints (a blues lounge in an informal setting) popped up in southern towns and cities. As the Great Migration of Black Americans blossomed from the 1910s–1930s, juke joints became popular in cities like Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and New York.</p>
      <p>Women played an important role in advancing the blues. Among the stars of the genre were vocalists Bessie Smith (deemed "empress of the blues"), Mamie Smith, and Ma Rainey, who recorded major hits with Louis Armstrong.</p>
      <p>Blues artists were prolific in the mid-twentieth century. Bluesmen like B.B. King, Bo Diddley, Leadbelly, and John Lee Hooker drew large crowds throughout the United States and Europe. This, in turn, inspired new genres of music including soul, rock ‘n' roll, and subgenres of jazz. Rhythm & blues music (R&B) directly names blues as one of its jumping off points.</p>
      <p>Today, nearly all popular music genres in Western music can trace at least some of their harmonic language to the blues.</p>

      <h2>Key Elements of Blues Music</h2>
      <p>The harmony is predominately related to the tonic, subdominant, and dominant. Minor 7th chords and other chord extensions are heard. Dissonant harmonies are a common feature.</p>
      <p>The blues scale is a variation of the pentatonic scale that includes an additional “blue” note – or the flattened fifth. The scale is used in both melody and soloing in blues music.</p>


      <h2>Around the World</h2>
      <p>Blues music, a genre deeply rooted in the African American experience, has significantly impacted popular music globally and evolved through various styles and regional interpretations. Originating from the rural South, it draws influences from African musical traditions, work songs, and spirituals. Chicago is often recognized as a global hub for blues music.</p>
      <p>The blues emerged from the oppressed, economically disadvantaged African-American communities in the rural southern states of America in the years following the American Civil War (1861–1865). Blues singers were descendants of slaves, and elements of their music reach back to African origins.</p>
