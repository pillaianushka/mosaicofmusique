        The term "pop music" refers to a combination of multiple highly popular musical genres within a society. The term "genre" identifies musical pieces as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions more or less accepted by the vast majority of music experts. Music authors David Hatch and Stephen Millward defined pop music as "a body of music, which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk music." Although pop music is often thought of as only chart-oriented singles, it is a musical style that is not necessarily the sum of all the music charts, which have always featured songs from a variety of different sources. Thus, the term "pop music" can be used to describe an independent genre, aimed at a young market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.
        Currently, pop music is very eclectic and adaptable as it borrows elements of different styles. Nowadays listening to pop music is part of our daily life, whether on the radio, the Internet, television, advertising, or in shops; pop music is part of our culture.

         <font size="4" color="orange" style="font-family:verdana"> <b>A Brief History of Pop Music</b></font><br>
         <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">
            Because pop music includes the influence and features of many genres, its origins date back to the early 20th century, when ragtime and its melodies were a trend on the dance floors. Between 1920 and 1930, jazz and its big band orchestras were in fashion. Between 1930 and 1940, blues and country dominated radio stations and public preference. The culmination of these trends and influences took place in the 1950s when the first pop music artists, such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra began to emerge. However, rock and roll also made its entrance around this time, so artists such as Bill Haley and His Comets and Elvis Presley became popular with the younger generation.In the 1970s, disco sounds began to permeate pop music, giving birth to artists like the Bee Gees. At the same time, artists who had their best weapons in the piano emerged, such as Elton John and Billy Joel. Other countries also began to make their contributions to pop, like Sweden with ABBA, a group that reached the peak of popularity.
            The 80s were characterized by the emergence of specific icons of pop, who became historical. Among these are Michael Jackson and Madonna, who were named the King and Queen of Pop. In the 90s, "boy bands" and "girl groups" trended. There was also a Latin explosion in pop, led by Ricky Martin. Finally, in the new century, new icons appeared, like Justin Timberlake (formerly of 'N Sync) and Avril Lavigne. Many new pop talents emerged from reality shows like American Idol.
            African American culture has also been very influential in pop. The genres ragtime, jazz, and blues have their origin in this culture and influenced many pop artists. During the rock and roll era, there were many African American artists who made significant contributions to music. Nowadays, genres like rap, soul, and R&B are incorporated into pop music, led by African American artists.
            The waves of both pop and rock and roll were focused in the United Kingdom and the United States. Rock and roll dominated the music scene until the end of the 1960s; however, pop was distinguished because it was associated with more commercial, ephemeral and accessible music. The decade began with teen idols like Johnny Tillotson and exploded midway with many new artists. It can be said that in the United States the most important artist of the time was Elvis Presley, and in the United Kingdom, the Beatles led the movement.

                The musical characteristics of pop music tend to be determined by the genre of music that is currently selling the most. Today, in the 21st Century, the most popular styles of music can all be classified as “songs,” meaning there is a vocalist and lyrics. Instrumental tracks rarely rise to popular music, unless they come from a film soundtrack, but even this is very rare. That said, there are certain elements of contemporary modern songs that are representative of a large majority of the modern genre as a whole.The structure of most modern popular songs involves verse and chorus, with the chorus serving as the part of the song that is specifically designed to stick in the ear and head through musical and lyrical repetition. It’s the part of the song that’s usually written to be the most “singable,” and therefore the more memorable.
                The chorus is usually what the music is building to, and is often proceeded by a “drop,” where the bass and drum parts literally “drop out.” This creates anticipation for the chorus, and creates an even greater impact when it arrives, bringing the drums and bass back with it
                Although this verse-chorus structure is common in today’s popular music, there are always variations.

                    Pop music is a global genre with broad appeal, but its sound varies worldwide by incorporating local rhythms, instruments, and languages, creating unique cultural fusions. Top artists and hits vary by region and platform, with recent examples including global chart-toppers like Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars, and regional favorites in Latin America and Asia. The genre continually adapts by absorbing influences from other popular styles such as hip hop, R&B, and electronic dance music.. Pop music itself is a global genre originating in the 1950s, while global compilations often blend international styles like Latin, African, and Balkan beats with pop music. Daft Punk's hit is a classic of French house and dance music, and Liverpool is recognized as a global "World Capital of Pop" by Guinness World Records. It is a global phenomenon with artists and styles varying by country, but the genre is heavily influenced by American and British music industries. Some countries known for their distinct pop scenes include South Korea (K-Pop), Russia (hardbass influence), and Japan, while Mexico and France also have their own unique pop styles.

        The term "pop music" refers to a combination of multiple highly popular musical genres within a society. The term "genre" identifies musical pieces as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions more or less accepted by the vast majority of music experts. Music authors David Hatch and Stephen Millward defined pop music as "a body of music, which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk music." Although pop music is often thought of as only chart-oriented singles, it is a musical style that is not necessarily the sum of all the music charts, which have always featured songs from a variety of different sources. Thus, the term "pop music" can be used to describe an independent genre, aimed at a young market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.
        Currently, pop music is very eclectic and adaptable as it borrows elements of different styles. Nowadays listening to pop music is part of our daily life, whether on the radio, the Internet, television, advertising, or in shops; pop music is part of our culture.

         <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">
            Because pop music includes the influence and features of many genres, its origins date back to the early 20th century, when ragtime and its melodies were a trend on the dance floors. Between 1920 and 1930, jazz and its big band orchestras were in fashion. Between 1930 and 1940, blues and country dominated radio stations and public preference. The culmination of these trends and influences took place in the 1950s when the first pop music artists, such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra began to emerge. However, rock and roll also made its entrance around this time, so artists such as Bill Haley and His Comets and Elvis Presley became popular with the younger generation.In the 1970s, disco sounds began to permeate pop music, giving birth to artists like the Bee Gees. At the same time, artists who had their best weapons in the piano emerged, such as Elton John and Billy Joel. Other countries also began to make their contributions to pop, like Sweden with ABBA, a group that reached the peak of popularity.
            The 80s were characterized by the emergence of specific icons of pop, who became historical. Among these are Michael Jackson and Madonna, who were named the King and Queen of Pop. In the 90s, "boy bands" and "girl groups" trended. There was also a Latin explosion in pop, led by Ricky Martin. Finally, in the new century, new icons appeared, like Justin Timberlake (formerly of 'N Sync) and Avril Lavigne. Many new pop talents emerged from reality shows like American Idol.
            African American culture has also been very influential in pop. The genres ragtime, jazz, and blues have their origin in this culture and influenced many pop artists. During the rock and roll era, there were many African American artists who made significant contributions to music. Nowadays, genres like rap, soul, and R&B are incorporated into pop music, led by African American artists.
            The waves of both pop and rock and roll were focused in the United Kingdom and the United States. Rock and roll dominated the music scene until the end of the 1960s; however, pop was distinguished because it was associated with more commercial, ephemeral and accessible music. The decade began with teen idols like Johnny Tillotson and exploded midway with many new artists. It can be said that in the United States the most important artist of the time was Elvis Presley, and in the United Kingdom, the Beatles led the movement.

                The musical characteristics of pop music tend to be determined by the genre of music that is currently selling the most. Today, in the 21st Century, the most popular styles of music can all be classified as “songs,” meaning there is a vocalist and lyrics. Instrumental tracks rarely rise to popular music, unless they come from a film soundtrack, but even this is very rare. That said, there are certain elements of contemporary modern songs that are representative of a large majority of the modern genre as a whole.The structure of most modern popular songs involves verse and chorus, with the chorus serving as the part of the song that is specifically designed to stick in the ear and head through musical and lyrical repetition. It’s the part of the song that’s usually written to be the most “singable,” and therefore the more memorable.
                The chorus is usually what the music is building to, and is often proceeded by a “drop,” where the bass and drum parts literally “drop out.” This creates anticipation for the chorus, and creates an even greater impact when it arrives, bringing the drums and bass back with it
                Although this verse-chorus structure is common in today’s popular music, there are always variations.

                    Pop music is a global genre with broad appeal, but its sound varies worldwide by incorporating local rhythms, instruments, and languages, creating unique cultural fusions. Top artists and hits vary by region and platform, with recent examples including global chart-toppers like Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars, and regional favorites in Latin America and Asia. The genre continually adapts by absorbing influences from other popular styles such as hip hop, R&B, and electronic dance music.. Pop music itself is a global genre originating in the 1950s, while global compilations often blend international styles like Latin, African, and Balkan beats with pop music. Daft Punk's hit is a classic of French house and dance music, and Liverpool is recognized as a global "World Capital of Pop" by Guinness World Records. It is a global phenomenon with artists and styles varying by country, but the genre is heavily influenced by American and British music industries. Some countries known for their distinct pop scenes include South Korea (K-Pop), Russia (hardbass influence), and Japan, while Mexico and France also have their own unique pop styles.
