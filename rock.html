       <font size="4" color="#3D5A80" style="font-family:verdana"> What is Rock?</font><br>
       <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">Rock music is a genre that has defined generations, serving as the voice of rebellion, passion, 
and change. Emerging in the mid-20th century, rock combines elements of rhythm and blues, country, and gospel with amplified instrumentation and 
dynamic vocals. Known for its driving beats, powerful guitar riffs, and raw emotional energy, rock has evolved over decades to encompass a wide 
range of styles and subgenres. From stadium anthems to introspective ballads, rock music continues to capture the spirit of individuality and 
defiance that resonates with listeners around the world.

         <font size="4" color="#3D5A80" style="font-family:verdana"> A Brief History of Rock</font><br>
         <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">The roots of rock music can be traced to the late 1940s and early 1950s
         when African-American rhythm and blues began to merge with the sounds of country and western music. Artists like Chuck Berry
         Little Richard, and Elvis Presley were among the pioneers who brought this new sound to mainstream audiences, creating what would 
         to be known as rock and roll. These early hits broke cultural and racial barriers, marking the beginning of a musical revolution.
<br><br>The 1960s saw rock music explode in popularity, driven by bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Who. This era, often referred to 
as the British Invasion, brought a wave of innovative music to the United States and beyond. Simultaneously, American artists like Bob Dylan and 
The Beach Boys were redefining rock with poetic lyrics and complex harmonies. Psychedelic rock emerged during this time, fueled by countercultural
movements and experimentation with sound.

In the 1970s, rock diversified into subgenres like hard rock, punk, and progressive rock. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Ramones 
each pushed the boundaries of what rock music could be. The 1980s introduced glam rock and heavy metal, with artists like Guns N’ Roses and 
Metallica dominating the scene, while the 1990s brought grunge and alternative rock, led by Nirvana and Radiohead. Today, rock continues to
evolve, blending with genres like electronic, pop, and even hip-hop, proving its enduring relevance.
