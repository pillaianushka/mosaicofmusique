       <font size="4" color="#ffffff" style="font-family:verdana"> What is Reggae music?</font><br> <br>
       <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s, characterized by a distinctive syncopated rhythm, often featuring a heavy backbeat played by the drums and guitar on the offbeats. It evolved from earlier Jamaican genres like ska and rocksteady and was heavily influenced by American jazz and rhythm and blues. Reggae often has spiritual and political lyrical themes, with Bob Marley being its most famous global proponent, and is deeply connected to the Rastafarian religion.

         <font size="4" color="#ffffff" style="font-family:verdana"> A Brief History of Reggae Music</font><br> <br>
         <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">Since the late 1960s, reggae has been the primary popular style of music in Jamaica. Its origins reflect the cultural hybridity for which the Caribbean is known. Reggae’s roots trace back to the late 1940s and 1950s when the Jamaican recording industry was in its infancy. Mento—a rural-based music that developed from the period of slavery and which came to be influenced by Trinidadian calypso in the urban context of Kingston, was then the popular music. By the late fifties, a new style known as ska burst onto the urban scene.




          As anthropologist Ken Bilby tells it, “Ska was born when urban Jamaican musicians began to play North American rhythm and blues, a style that had penetrated the island via imported records and radio broadcasts from Miami and other parts of the southern United States.”Reggae music entered the scene in 1968, retaining the basic rhythmic structures of the popular styles that preceded it. This included the syncopated snare drum and hi-hat pulse of ska, the swaying guitar and bass interplay of rocksteady, along with the continuing influence of mento and the Nyahbinghi drumming tradition. Reggae riddims—with their emphasis on the downbeat on two and four—evolved from the signature “one drop” style mastered by Carleton Barrett, drummer for the Bob Marley and the Wailers, to “rockers”—a rhythm most identified with the drumming duo of Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare—to “steppers,” another evolution in the reggae beat.

                The most recognizable feature is the "skank," where the guitar and organ play short, staccato chords on the offbeats (the "and" between the main beats

                The drum pattern often emphasizes the third beat of a 4/4 measure, known as the "one drop". The kick and snare drums work together to create this laid-back groove.

                Reggae is known for its deliberate, slower tempo compared to its predecessors, ska and rocksteady.

                 <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana"">When reggae emerged in the late 1960s, it came as a cultural bombshell not only to Jamaica but the whole world. Reggae has influenced societies throughout the world, contributing to the development of new counterculture movements, particularly in Europe, in the USA and Africa. Indeed, by the end of the 1960s, it participated in the birth of the skinhead movement in the UK. In the 1970s, it impacted on Western punk rock/ pop cultures and inspired the first rappers in the USA. Finally, since the late 1970s onwards, it has also influenced singers originating from Africa, Alpha Blondy, Tiken Jah Fakoly and Lucky Dube being perfect examples. Thus, my paper will examine the impact of Jamaican reggae music on the worldwide cultural universe, especially on Europe, the USA and Africa.Reggae music, originating in Jamaica, has become a global phenomenon influencing and fusing with music worldwide, from Latin America and Africa to Japan and Europe. Its distinctive rhythms, socially conscious messages, and spiritual depth have made it a powerful force, even recognized by UNESCO as a form of intangible cultural heritage. Popular worldwide, especially through artists like Bob Marley and events like the Reggae Sumfest, reggae's legacy lives on in contemporary music and counterculture movements across the globe.

   <font size="3" style="font-family:verdana" align="left">
    <br><br>




Notable reggae music composers include Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer of The Wailers, as well as Jimmy Cliff. Other influential composers are Toots Hibbert (of Toots and the Maytals), Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, and Burning Spear. These artists, and many others, were pivotal in shaping reggae's sound and lyrical content, which often reflects social and political themes.
   
<p align="left">Burning Spear, also known as Winston Rodney, is no doubt one of the most enduring reggae artists of all time. He is still recording and giggling today, over 40 years on. Burning Spear's first landmark album was 1975's 'Marcus Garvey', which extolled the politics of the activist of the same name, and which became known as the beginnings of dread roots reggae. The album includes both the title track as well as another underground hit, 'Slavery Days', two of Burning Spear's most popular hits of all time which still get regular airplay on the radio.</p>
<p>Steel Pulse formed in Birmingham in 1975. They are a roots reggae band whose songs often focused on themes of social injustice and racism. Despite rising popularity in the UK, Steel Pulse were often banned from playing live gigs in the UK due to their controversial Rastafarian beliefs, and yet they still rocketed to international fame and became the first reggae band to ever play on The Tonight Show in the US. They also became the first non-Jamaican band to win a Grammy award for the Best Reggae Album, with their landmark album 'Babylon the Bandit' in 1987.</p>




<p>Peter Tosh was one of the original members of Bob Marley's Wailers, but he went on to have a successful solo career after his time with the Wailers. Peter Tosh exemplified reggae culture, as a proud Rastafarian with strong ties to Jamaica. One of his biggest hits was the song 'Legalize It', which was all about legalizing marijuana. Unfortunately, Peter Tosh was murdered in an armed robbery in 1987.</p>




<p>Born in Kingston in 1976, Sizzla has brought reggae into the 21st century. He's released a whopping 56 albums to date, with some of the most important being 1997's 'Praise Ye Jah' and 2013's 'The Messiah', which brought Sizzla his first Grammy nomination. Some of his most loved tracks include 'Thank U Mamma' and 'I'm Living'. No other contemporary artist has managed to recreate the popularity of reggae throughout the 70s and 80s as Sizzla has today.</p>




<p>Toots and the Maytals, who first got together in 1962, deserve a special nod since their 1968 single 'Do they Reggay' was actually the first popular song to use the word 'reggae', and likely gave the genre its name. Toots and the Maytals managed to bag several Grammy award nominations throughout their career, and were once described as 'The Beatles to the Wailer's Rolling Stones'. One of the groups' biggest chart successes was the hit song 'Louie Louie', taken from their milestone album 'Funky Kingston'.</p>
<p>One of the earliest reggae hitmakers was Desmond Dekker, who sang in his authentic Jamaican dialect on a number of reggae classics such as 'Israelites' and 'It Miek'. Dekker introduced the UK to Jamaican rude boy culture and paved the way for the likes of Bob Marley with his songs about the daily struggles of Jamaican people. Dekker recorded his most famous hits with Leslie Kong, who produced his music from 1963 on. Together, they recorded some of his most seminal albums including '007 Shanty Town' and 'Action!', both of which paved the way for reggae music both in the UK and abroad.</p>




<p>Bob Marley rose to fame with his backing band, The Wailers, starting in 1963. Bob Marley's songs sounded peaceful but were often political, with popular themes of love, redemption, and struggle. Bob Marley released countless timeless singles including 'I Shot the Sheriff', 'Redemption Song', and 'No Woman No Cry'. Perhaps the most iconic Bob Marley album is 'Exodus', released during the birth of punk in 1977; the album contains some of his biggest hits including 'Three Little Birds', and 'One Love'.</p>
